				<h2 className="text-align-center">Cookies policy</h2>
			</a>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>By visiting or using this web application (webapp), a cookie will be created which the Digital Public Goods Alliance may use to provide statistics that help us to give you the best experience of our sites. The statement below describes our policy on cookies.</p>

			<p>If you do not agree with any of the following, you can switch off the cookies. However, by continuing to use our sites without changing settings, you are agreeing to our use of cookies.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<h4>What is a cookie?</h4>

			<p>During the course of any visit to our websites, the pages which you see, along with something called a cookie, are downloaded to your computer. Most, if not all, websites do this, and that’s because cookies allow the website publisher to do useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably its user) has visited the site before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.</p>

			<p>So – what is a cookie? When you enter a site your computer will automatically be issued with a cookie. Cookies are text files which identify your computer to our server. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their site, in order to track traffic flows. Cookies themselves only record which areas of the site have been visited by the computer in question, and for how long. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time, although this of course means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user. You should read the information that came with your browser software to see how you can do this. Even assuming you have not set your computer to reject cookies, you can browse our sites anonymously until such time as you register your information with the Digital Public Goods Alliance.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<h5>What do cookies tell us?</h5>

			<p>We use cookies to collect data for analytics, such as demographic and interest data, based on your browsing patterns. This data allows us to estimate your age range, your gender and things that might interest you.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<h5>What do we use cookies for?</h5>

			<p>We use cookies so that we can give you a better experience when you return to our websites. In particular, we use cookies to:</p>

			<ul><li>better understand our audience and supporters, for example by estimating our audience size and patterns and tracking the level of interest in our campaigns;</li>
				<li>track your preferences and personalise the sites to your requirements and interests;</li>
				<li>avoid lengthy registration/personalisation on each visit;</li>
				<li>improve and update our websites.</li>
				<li>specifically to the Submission Form webapp, we use cookies to "remember" you and autosave the information that you are inputing to the form; so that we can restore a partially filled form if your session is interrupted.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<h5>How do we collect and analyze cookies?</h5>

			<p>The Digital Public Goods Alliance uses a specialist service provider which both collects information on your preferences from your visits to our websites and analyzes your preferences from cookies already stored in your browser.</p>

			<p>We obtain this information by enabling Google Analytics to analyze the traffic on our websites via "Google Advertising Cookies". Google Advertising Cookies are a series of cookies already stored in your browser that compile data from your browsing preferences. You can see the types of cookies used by Google and learn more about the different categories in the&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/types">Google privacy &amp; terms</a>.</p>

			<p>We may change our specialist service provider at any time without notice to you and will update this Policy as necessary at that time.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<h5>What can you do if you do not want us to use your cookies?</h5>

			<ul><li>Configure how we use your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Analytics information</a>.</li>
				<li>If you would like to opt out of all Google Analytics tracking services then you can install an Add-on.&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">Find out about more about Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</li>
				<li>Alternatively, you can use your browsers’ private browsing mode. Common browsers like Google Chrome, Brave, Safari and Internet Explorer have this functionality. Bear in mind that in doing so, you will also lose the ability to restore a previous session, and you will have to start from the beginning in the case that your browsing session is interrupted.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<h5>How do I opt-out of the collection and use of information for promotional purposes generally?</h5>

			<p>There are many websites that provide guidance on how to opt out of the collection and use of your information for promotional purposes that are not limited to the Digital Public Goods Alliance web properties. For example:</p>

			<ul><li><a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads settings</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Choice Tool</a></li>
			</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

			<h5>Do you share data from cookies with other organizations?</h5>

			<p>We do not sell or share any data from your cookies to any third party without prior consent.</p>
